# OpenClaw Plugin System

Plugins extend OpenClaw with channels, tools, voice, and background services. They run in-process with the gateway.

## Install commands

```bash
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/matrix     # official npm plugin
openclaw plugins install powermem             # community plugin
openclaw plugins install github:User/Repo    # from GitHub
openclaw plugins list                         # show loaded
```

## Config pattern

Plugins are activated in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@openclaw/matrix", "powermem"],
  "matrix": { "homeserver": "...", "accessToken": "..." }
}
```

Each plugin may add its own top-level config key.

## Plugin types

- **Channel**: messaging platform adapters (Matrix, Teams, Nostr, Telegram)
- **Tool**: API/hardware integrations (PowerMem, Exoshell)
- **Voice**: phone call providers (Twilio, Telnyx, Plivo)
- **Background**: long-running services

## Curated plugins for this setup

| Plugin | Package | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Matrix | `@openclaw/matrix` | Decentralized E2E-encrypted messaging |
| PowerMem | `powermem` | Ebbinghaus-curve long-term memory |
| MemOS Cloud | `github:MemTensor/MemOS-Cloud-OpenClaw-Plugin` | Cloud persistent context |
| Voice Call | `@openclaw/voice-call` | Telephony via Twilio/Telnyx |
| Exoshell | `exoshell` | Claude-powered dev utilities |

## Security

- Always review plugin source before install
